 Write a program that can determine the number of days in a month for a specified month
 and year. The program should allow a user to enter two integers representing a month and
 a year, and it should determine how many days are in the specified month . The integers 1
 through 12 will be used to identify the months of January through December. The user
 indicates the end of input by entering O O for the month and year. At that point, the
 program prints the number of days in the current month and terminates.
 Use the following criteria to identify leap years:
 1. A year Y is divisible by 100. Then Y is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by
 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not .
 2. A year Y is not divisible by 100. Then Y is a leap year if and only if it is divisible
 by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not .
 Here is sample run of the program:
 Enter mont h and year: 2 2008[Enter]
 29 days
 Enter mont h and year: 0 O[Enter]
 The current month, September 2009, has 30 days.
